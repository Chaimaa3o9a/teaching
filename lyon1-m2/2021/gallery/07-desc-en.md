# Mobile data consumption viewer

We are 4 students of the M2 Data Science at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1 and we offer the visualization
of personal data concerning our mobile data consumption during the month of December 2021.

The data of 2 members of the group were obtained thanks to the mobile application GlassWire.
In addition to the overall consumption, we have identified the most consuming applications and compared them.
We chose: Discord, Chrome, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram and Messenger.
We also divided the day into 8 slices: every 3 hours, we detail the consumption of each application.

We have chosen four different visualizations: a histogram representing the sum of mobile data consumption for each application, curves showing the evolution of 
mobile data consumption for each slice
two doughnuts, and finally a heatmap.
